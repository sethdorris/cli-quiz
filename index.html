				<P>Since there was no mother for the peach tree we did it 
					all alone, <span class="fav">which made the two of us closer</span>
					though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would
					have been better I think sometimes to be sterile
					from the start just to avoid the pain 
					which in my life this far has lasted seventy
					years for I am in love with a skeleton
					on whose small bones a dress hung for a while,
					on whose small skull a bit of curly hair
					was strung, and what is dust I still don’t know
					since there was no mother to turn to then and ask
					what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes,
					and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it
					true somebody said the other peach
					should have died instead of her; and I could 
					imagine the nose going first though forty years later
					the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think;
					and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips
					who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity,
					a flabby body, half the house was filled with 
					male cousins, they were born in rooms a 
					short distance from the rats, I can’t remember
					which ones had the accents nor what his
					Hebrew name was, nor his English.

					Laughing below, the unimagined room
					in unimagined mouths, a turning mood
					speaking itself the way a fulling should
					overspilling into something’s dome,
				</p>
				<p>
					some moment’s edging over into bloom.
					What is a happening but conscious cloud
					seeking its edge in a wound or word
					pellucidity describing term
				</p>
				<p>
					as boundary, body, violated bourne
					no sounding center, circumscription turn.
					<span class="fav">Mother of mirrors, angel of the acts,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					do all the sighing breathing clicking wilds
					summon the same blue breadth the sense subtracts,
					the star suborning in its ruptured fields.
